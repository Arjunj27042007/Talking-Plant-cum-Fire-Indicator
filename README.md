# Talking-Plant-cum-Fire-Indicator
Hi Everyone , 
The project, Talking Plant cum Fire Indicator, is a continuous temperature and humidity monitor for plants. It is programmed in such a way that the plant can 'tell' about its current environment. It can also be used for safety purposes. This is the description and overview of my project.

This device is made using :
1 Arduino Uno
2 16*2 LCD
3 TMP36 Temperature Sensor
4 Buzzer
5 LED
6 Resistor ( 1 kΩ and 220 kΩ )

I made this project for an Event named as "Minimal Component Design " conducted by IEEE SB NSSCE.
